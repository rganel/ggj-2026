Input System Package - Demo Instructions

Note: If you're using the evaluation version, it's precompiled with support 
for the legacy Input Manager (Old) for compatibility with users on older 
Unity versions so you must set Edit > Project Settings > Player Settings >
Other Settings > Active Input Handling to Both or Input Manager (Old).
Once you update to the full Asset Store version, you'll be able to switch
to Input System Package (New).

If you're using the Asset Store version, select menu item Tools > Pixel Crushers > 
Dialogue System > Welcome Window. Make sure the USE_NEW_INPUT checkbox is ticked.
